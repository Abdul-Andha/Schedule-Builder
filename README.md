# Schedule Builder

### App Description
This project is for HackNYU2022. Users input their tasks and availability at the start of the week. Then, the algorithm splits the tasks evenly across
the user's availability and presents them with a schedule they can follow to make sure they stay on track. The schedule is also available to download.
